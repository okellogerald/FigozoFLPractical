# ARCHITECTURE
The architecture is made following the layer-first approach. There are basically two layes: The data layer and the presentation layer.  
The Data layer is responsible for performing network / local calls e.g fetching data from apis and the
Presentation layer is responsible for performing presentation logic and as a result show a piece of UI
on the screen.

These two layers are further sub-divided to their sub-layers:
The Data layer is sub-divided to the API and the Repository layers. The API layer will perform
network / local calls and return unstructured data e.g json. The sole responsibility of the Repository layer
is to
convert the unstructured data from the API layer to structured predefined data:- models.

The Presentation layer is sub-divided to State-Notifiers and Pages layer. Pages are mere UIs (widgets). But
what UI is to be rendered on the screen is completely under the control of the state-notifiers. Hence the
saying UI = f(state) holds true for this case.

State Notifiers are created using Getx-Controllers. States are created using Freezed.
